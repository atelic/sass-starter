Sass Starter
============

A starter kit with everything you need for building websites using Sass

Sass Starter as entered Version 2.0.0! Lots of exciting changes have been made. It now ships with an entirely new file structure better suited for more scalable sites  fitting needs from static sites to dynamic web apps. I have also added more HTML-centric aspects to get sites up and running faster.

At its heart, this is a file and resource setup for building websites with Sass. This starter comes with [Bourbon](www.bourbon.io) mixin library, [Neat](www.neat.bourbon.io) grid, and [Bitters](www.bitters.bourbon.io) base styling, all made by the aweseome team at [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/).  It also includes [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) for web apps, [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for rapid prototyping, [Underscore.js Library](http://underscorejs.org/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/). Feel free to add, remove, or modify anything included.

Feel free to clone and use for your own websites. Just set your Sass compiler to watch ```main.sass``` and output it to ```main.css``` and you're ready to start coding! NEW: Alternatively, you can run `gulp watch` to watch, compile and output your Sass and CSS. No extra work for you!
