Sass starter
============

A simple starter kit for websites with SASS

This is a simple file setup for building websites with SASS. This starter comes with [Bourbon](www.bourbon.io) mixin library, [Neat](www.neat.bourbon.io) grid, and [Bitters](www.bitters.bourbon.io) base styling, all made by the aweseome team at [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/). 

Feel free to clone and use for your own websites. Just set your SASS compiler to watch ```main.sass``` and output it to ```main.css``` and you're ready to start coding! 

For customization ideas, I recommend visiting [Bourbon's website.](www.bourbon.io)
